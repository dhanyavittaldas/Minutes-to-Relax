  not functioning in the right way. A good amount of time to fix it .

* Random quotes to be added if the user input incorrect or correct answer - Random quotes was created and was happy with the execution.
  Later realised that the quotes were not printing randomly. I had the code outside the function and that was the reason why I was unable
